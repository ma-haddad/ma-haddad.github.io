I’m an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics at Yazd University and a member of the Atomic and Molecular physics group.
<DIV align="justify">
As a scientist, I’m broadly interested in Optics, Lasers, and Spectroscopy, particularly in applied nonlinear optics, molecular physics, laboratory astrophysics, and laser applications in life and sciences.

Prior to this, I was a guest researcher and Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Vrije University Amsterdam (VU Amsterdam) and Leiden University. I completed my Ph.D. thesis entitled “Cavity Ring-Down Laser Spectroscopy of Carbon-Chain Molecules” under the supervision of Prof. dr. Wim Ubachs (VU Amsterdam) and Prof. dr. Harrold Linnartz (Leiden University) and co-supervision of Dr. Dongfeng Zhao. In my thesis, I focused on high-resolution laser spectroscopy of carbon-based molecules in the laboratory and observation in space; diffuse interstellar bands. More details about my Ph.D. thesis can be found here. 

Before I joined VU Amsterdam, I graduated with an M.Sc. in atomic and molecular physics from Yazd University. In my Master’s thesis, I experimentally studied selective multiphoton absorption and multiphoton dissociation of polyatomic molecular isotopologues using a high-power pulsed gas laser. I completed My M.Sc thesis under the supervision of Prof. dr. Abbas Behjat and advised by Eng. Kaveh Silakhori.
