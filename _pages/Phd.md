<h3><strong>Abstract:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
</section>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Diffuse interstellar bands or DIBs are absorption features, which have been observed along many lines of sight toward reddened background stars in the Milky Way and even toward other galaxies. In spite of the fact that significant progress has been achieved in understanding the chemistry of the interstellar medium, the chemical and astrophysical models cannot explain the DIBs&rsquo; features. The origin of these phenomena, observed in the near UV, VIS and near IR ranges (covering 400 to 1000 nm) constitutes the oldest unsolved puzzle of astronomical spectroscopy. Several hypotheses for DIB-carriers have been proposed, such as H2, solid particles, fullerene-like molecules, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and carbon chains. Two classes of molecules have been investigated in much detail over the last years: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their cations and carbon chain molecules of various kinds.In the experimental approach of identifying DIBs&rsquo; carriers, a variety of laser-based spectroscopic techniques have been used to record optical transitions of carbon-based molecules. The gas-phase spectra of the neutrals and ionic radicals can be measured by a number of methods, such as cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRD), resonant two-color two-photon ionization (R2C2PI), laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), trapped-ion photo-fragmentation, and photo-detachment spectroscopy.<br />
My research was focused on high-resolution cavity ring-down laser spectroscopy of (hydro)-carbon chains radicals of astrophysical interest as well as their D- and 13C-substituted isotopologues, which are generated in a jet-cooled supersonically expanding plasma. Sensitive pulsed cavity ring-down techniques, combined with molecule formation in an expanding plasma, enable to record high-resolution absorption gas phase spectra of electronic transitions a series of carbon-chains and their isotopologues. The gas phase data provided by these techniques, specifically the methods based on recording direct absorption spectra, can be compared with observational data, for instance, the DIBs profiles. As a second goal, a systematic study of the high-resolution spectra &ndash; recorded at low temperatures in the range of several kelvins &ndash; allows us to characterize the spectroscopic constants in the ground an excited electronic states, and this also provides information on molecular structure.The research has been carried out under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Wim Ubachs and Prof. Dr. Harold Linnartz at VU University Amsterdam.&nbsp;Full-text of my thesis&nbsp;already made<a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/cavity-ring-down-laser-spectroscopy-of-carbon-chain-molecules">&nbsp;<em>available here</em></a>!</p>
